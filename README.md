# Am I Productive?

This is a simple productivity tracker that helps you keep track of your daily tasks and how much time you spend on them. It is a simple command line application that allows you to add tasks, start and stop them, and view reports on how much time you have spent on each task. Additionally, you can export the reports to a CSV file for further analysis.
There is also an option for a study timer that will help you focus on your work for a set amount of time.

## Installation

To install the application, simply clone the repository and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/adrianH5/your-repo-name.git
```

## Features

## API Reference

## Future Plans

- Website Blocking: Implement a feature that allows users to block certain websites during their study time to avoid distractions.  
- Task Integration: Integrate with popular task management tools like Trello or Asana. This would allow users to import tasks and track time against them directly within the extension.  
- Detailed Reports: Enhance the reporting feature to include more detailed statistics, such as time spent per task, per day, or per website.  
- Notifications: Add a feature to send notifications to users when they have spent a certain amount of time on a website or when their study time is over.  
- Sync Across Devices: Allow the extension to sync data across multiple devices so users can track their productivity no matter where they are working from.
